# (1) See if data can be cleaned up to remove missing variables from 2009-13 and so increase sample size.
# 
# Try not to invest too much time in this.
# 

 
# (2) For the analyses that span all months, remove either ‘month’ or ‘bloom dummy’.

# My personal instinct is to remove month so we can retain the ‘bloom dummy x sunflower acreage’ interaction

# but I am open to advice.


# (3) Do analyses once for all years (both Aug/Sept analysis, and analysis of all months with interaction term) 
# and do again for only 2014-15, including apiary size as a covariate.


# (4) Start preparing some figures/interpretation to visualize size and direction of effect.
