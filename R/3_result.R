# 1.	Check how well model fits the data (lots of zeroes; mites are count data) and try using models with distributions that fit the data (zero-inflated, Poisson, negative binomial?); assess model fit to  ensure we are using appropriate models. Kathy also suggested log-transforming mites (and Nosema?) as a possible fix.


 
# 2. Restricting analysis to only states that grow sunflower (above some minimum bar of acreage for the state), now that we have a larger sample size.
 
# 3. Trying a 4 mile instead of 2-mile radius. (need more time for the geoprocessing to worked out ) 

 
# 4. Kathy suggested including year as a fixed effect.

 
# 5. Given that results seem similar whether sunflower is used as a continuous or categorical predictor, for the sake of efficiency I suggest using as continuous (sunflower acreage).
